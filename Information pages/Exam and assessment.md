#### Exam and assessment
- The course includes an Examinarium exam. Only degree students at the University of Helsinki and students who have registered for the course at the Open University can take the exam and receive a completion mark and credits for the course. Others can of course freely access the material and do the assignments, but no certificates of completion can be obtained unless they take the Examinarium exam.

- The Examinarium exam is taken in a special exam room at the university.

- Successful completion of the course requires a sufficient score (approx. 80% of the maximum points) on the examinarium exam.

- The Examinarium exam is automatically graded in its entirety, so be very careful with your answers. The automatic comparison of answers does not accept, for example, spelling errors. Most of the tasks are multiple choice, but there are some so-called gap tasks that require one or two-word answers.
- The goal is that everyone has learned enough during the course to pass the exam on the first try. Therefore, you can only take the exam after you have studied the course and completed the assignments.

- If you fail the exam for one reason or another, you can of course retake it, but before retaking it, it is worth reviewing the entire course material and its assignments again.
