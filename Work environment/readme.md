#### Work Enviornments
- The assignments can be done on any Unix-like operating system. In practice, this usually means Linux or macOS computers. If possible, we recommend that, with the exception of the SSH assignment, the assignments be done on departmental computers running the university's own Linux distribution, Cubbli .
- Depending on the operating system and the command line interpreter in use, there may be differences in the first part of the material, especially in your environment. Unless otherwise stated, the material assumes a Debian-based Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu/Cubbli) and Bash as the command line interpreter.
- Windows is not part of the Unix-like operating system family . It uses different command names and a different syntax. Not all Unix functionality is available in the Windows shell, although some can be done with different named commands.
- You should be able to do the tasks on macOS. However, if you want a full Linux environment, the VirtualBox mentioned below should also work on Mac.
